<h1>The 3 R's</h1>

<div id="p1">Reduce</div>
<p>As you can likely deduce from its being the first of the three R’s, reducing is the best way to go about managing solid waste. It’s quite simple really, the less you use the less waste you will produce. This R causes the most unease in consumers because we tend to think we need to cut back on everything or we won’t be making an impact. This is not the case, though. By just doing a few things to cut back you can noticeably reduce your waste without totally altering your lifestyle.</p>

<div id="p2">Reuse</div>
<p>The second R is for reuse. This one is becoming more and more popular with the surge of upcycling and craft projects all over the web. If you reuse something as opposed to throwing it away you keep waste out of landfills and create something new. </p>

<div id="p3">Recycle</div>
<p>The final, and probably the best known, R stands for recycling. As you probably know, recycling is the process of remanufacturing a product to be sold as new. Along with the basics of paper, plastic, glass, and cardboard there are tons of items which can be recycled that you may not even realize. And remember, recycling only works if you complete the process by buying recycled materials</p>
